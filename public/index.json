[{"content":"Music is a big part of my day to day, of my life even. I love music, I’m completely sure that the world would be drastically worse without music in any kind of form. But that could be said of almost any type of art, I guess that’s why art has such an impactful influence in the world and in human lives, either those who make or those who enjoy it.\nMusic for me is:\nComfort: it relaxes me, makes me feel calm and at ease. Love: a form of letting my love for someone take a musical form that I can share. Empathetic: music can make 2 (or even more) different individuals connect. Fun: music can be fun, make you laugh or dance and sing. A very good way to judge people based on what they like. Without more yapping from me side of the screen, and in no particular order, I present to you:\n5 SONGS WITH A BIG PLACE IN MY HEART audible claps and cheering\nRead with a cool narrator voice, maybe Morgan Freeman, or that girl from WatchMojo\nNUMBER 1 We have a very short but lovely song, Jack Johnson’s Angel from his album Sleep Through The Static.\nIn my opinion, one of the best albums by mister Johnson. It makes you feel like static but in a good way. An almost thematic album with songs that feel extraordinarily personal and impersonal at the same time, making you feel nostalgic and sad, but in the good way. A lot of feel feelings felt if you know what I mean. Angel is that one song I will only share with the love of my life. It encapsulates in just 2 minutes how I want my love life to be: with a lovely angel making little angels. Jack Johnson is one of my all-time favorite artists, his music is kind of a fraction of the definition of my personality, a big fraction, like 15/16. There’s really not a lot I want to say about this song or Jack himself, other than there’s more to “feel” about it. Only listen to the song if you are the love of my life.\nRead in a boxing match announcer voice\nAND ON THE BLUE CORNER, NUUUUUMMMBEEERR TWWOOOOOO Julio Cesar Chavez shadow-boxing showing off\nHad to do it, sorry.\nThe next one is a song with a “fuzzy-chill-nightime-madrugada” vibe. HONNE’s Warm On a Cold Night from their EP album Warm On a Cold Night, and their later album Warm on a Cold Night, afterward called Warm On a Cold Night (Deluxe).\nIt’s only game, why you haff to be mad?\nIn all seriousness, this song got to me in a time in my life where I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any sort of worries or stress, it arrived one cold night to make my heart feel warm. It presented me with the existence of this English music duo that makes awesome music with a very heartfelt and heartwarming side to it. Without a doubt, it became one of my favorite bands/duo in this beautiful but Cold Night of a world. I had to repeat the name so you get stuck with it and have to listen to the song, GO now! WAIT!!\nBefore you go, this song has a very big place in my heart. HONNE is also one of the favorite duos of my great and mathematically norteño friend: Luis Mario.\nThat we both found out “accidentally” that we loved their music is one of the best moments of our friendship, it could be compared with those moments in movies where two white girls meet and scream at each other dramatically and annoyingly AF, but in a cool just-two-bros-having-something-they-both-love-in-common way. You can keep reading now, kisses.\nNow read out-loud in your lovely voice, but in a cool way\nI’M DICK nice to meet you… NUMBER THREEE me laughing alone in some café\nYou just got got. “Fooled” in understandable and civil terms.\nNow I present to you, Dromedarios Magicos \u0026amp; José Madero’s Las Horas from Dromedarios album Bicampeón.\nHonorable mentions: Tu Cama and Los Malaventurados No Lloran, the former is by Dromedarios the latter is by Jose Madero (Panda lead vocal, stylized as PXNDX).\nNow this one is a tricky one, but not on the “got got” way you experienced; more like in a “this reminds me of my late friend”.\nI know death is a serious matter, but this is my friend and my way of handling these types of topics. José Madero is, or was, my friend’s (Alberto Mendoza) favorite artist, the song doesn’t really have anything related to how I felt about him or our relationship, but it’s a really nice song that for some reason makes me remember him and what he represented in my life. In life and death, my friend would have a laugh or two reading this post, and that makes me happy.\nBy now just read it however you prefer… Psych! Do it as if it was the DK rap\nHe-he-here we go! So they\u0026rsquo;re finally here, performing for you\nIf you know the words, you can join in too\nPut your hands together, if you want to clap\nAs we take you through this monkey rap!\nHuh!\nN4, Number four! Old and cringe just like any respectable Dad.\nNote\nI’m not even sorry.\nThis song has been in my life since I can remember, so like 2006 or later. Man, getting old is hard, but I digress.\nFrom genre defining Celtic Metal band, Mägo de Oz’z Molinos de Viento is one hell of a song that accompanied me throughout all my puberty and then some more. Awesome people who really like metal and music in general agree that Mago’s Molinos de viento is a fucking banger, all-time classic, ageless tune to bang your head to and sing out loud holding a beer tankard making a mess of a random Irish bar that for some reason plays Spanish pagan rock music so it starts with Molinos then Fiesta Pagana begins, and every single one gets up and fucking sings their heart out.\nMago de Oz has a more meaningful way of making music, they make statements, display pagan and/or non-religious ideas that make you realize that paying the “diezmo” it’s like getting scammed. Church, not a cool dude making you pay some money just because the havens say they need more buildings and gold statues, or new streets and that it\u0026rsquo;s for your wellbeing, then you have to present your income for the year and get asked questions to see how much you have to pay by April 15th or the end of the fiscal year, shit wrong Capitalist, I mean, organization. You get what I mean. These dudes were the beginning of some culturally charged movement that opposed some of the best ingrained ideas people have even at this point in time.\nTalking religion it’s not the point nor something I\u0026rsquo;m an expert on, but free speech bitch one finger you know well.\nMago de Oz = Metal-fucking-good-meaningful music.\nLast but not least.\nI know we have been through a lot reading this post, maybe you had fun, I did. The time has come that you read the last one, but will do it together, ready?\nRead as if your brother’s name was Mario and because of that also your last name is Mario, so you can\u0026rsquo;t escape the fate of always being that green guy always behind some red dude that can\u0026rsquo;t keep one bitch safe.\nITS A MEEE NUMBER FIIIVEE!! Note: I did not do more numbers because I\u0026rsquo;m not creative enough to keep this nonsense going.\nFinally, the best Bolero duo, Daniel, Me Estás Matando’s Somos algo from the album Grandes Éxitos del Boleroglam Vol. 1, it\u0026rsquo;s one of my favorite songs by Daniel. A unique spin on the Bolero genre that keeps its roots but refreshes the production with a more contemporary vibe and more “current” lyrics.\nThis is another special one for me for two reasons:\nThey are fucking fantastic and make great Boleros.\nBoleros was the favorite music genre of my late grandmother. Every single time I listen to Daniel, she is the only thing on my mind, then I imagine what she would have said if I showed her how they sounded like. I never had the opportunity to do so, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it, but I\u0026rsquo;m completely sure that she would have enjoyed their music. She used to listen a lot of music all the time, and from almost every genre, she didn’t care. I loved hearing her humming to a random song that she didn\u0026rsquo;t know, but obviously she liked.\nSo these dudes almost make me cry every time I listen to them, but in a happy-sad way. I can certainly say that they are the 1/16 that\u0026rsquo;s left of my personality.\nAaaaand that’s about it, for now at least. I love music and have so much more songs to share and give my feelings about, but I wanted to keep this post a little more short, and kind of give my “whys” and make “stupid read-like-this jokes” that I didn\u0026rsquo;t plan on doing. I will most likely do more posts about music and songs I love. Finally, I hope you had a nice time reading and at least listen to one of the songs I mentioned, if not, then go fu…\nHard cut to credits.\nIn loving memory of the most loving grandma, Maria del Carmen Loera and Alberto “Pato” Mendoza, a great friend with a big heart and a fucked up sense of humor, just as black as mine.\nProduced and Directed by yours truly,\nOscar Fdz\n","permalink":"https://oscar-fdz.com/posts/5-songs-i-love/","summary":"Music is a big part of my day to day, of my life even.

Simple, metroidvania is a term used to refer to action-adventure games that have a specific set of characteristics and mechanics, the most obvious one is that these types of games are “open-ended” meaning that you can back-track your steps and acquire new items or maybe a new skill that helps you make progress in the game. The term comes from the fusion of two game titles: Metroid (1986) and Castlevania (1986).\nThe very first Metroid game, 1986\nThe first Castlevania game, 1986\nThe former, an action-adventure platformer game created by Nintendo, where the player controls the bounty hunter Samus Aran, who protects the galaxy from Space Pirates and other malevolent forces and their attempts to harness the power of the parasitic Metroid creatures.\nThe latter, an action-adventure platformer game largely set in the mysterious castle of Count Dracula, the main antagonist of the Belmont clan of vampire hunters. Almost every instance of the game has you taking control of one of the Belmont\u0026rsquo;s family member or even Dracula’s son, Alucard.\nFun fact: Alucard is just Dracula spelled backwards, really creative.\nThese types of games are very popular amongst hardcore and casual gamers because they offer a simple and stylish way of playing with a really nice touch of nostalgia to those who have been playing games since the very first metroidvanias games appear. Also, they just are fun and straightforward, you can only go left or right, maybe up and down but that\u0026rsquo;s it; 2D fun that gets you immerse in a world where you need to find your way into or out off.\nNote: there are some 3D games that are considered metroidvanias, but we are talking about the OG’s. Chill.\nSo what? Nothing bro, metroidvanias are a lot of fun. If you have never played one, I will recommend you to play a Metroid game, Metroid: zero mission, to be precise. This is a remake of the original Metroid. It was released for the Game Boy, so if you can’t get it using legal and regular means. Just download an emulator and enjoy the retro experience I loved having on my Game Boy Advance SP.\nAND, if you are a tech newbie, just play a new (or not so new) one, there\u0026rsquo;s lots and lots of great metroidvanias out there. Just to name a few:\nHollow Knight Skul: The hero slayer Dead Cells Guacamelee! Blasphemous Axiom verge Ori and the blind forest Metroid: Dread Metroid Prime Castlevania: Symphony of the night Castlevania: Aria of sorrow If you notice, the last 4 are the original games, where the concept came from, so you need an emulator to play those, or maybe you are a Nintendo bi… boy and you have a Switch console where you can play some of them using Nintendo shitty online service.\nI don’t have anything against Nintendo games, but as a company they suck ass and don’t have any consideration for us gamers at all, nor even care for game preservation. A fucking crime if you ask me, but I digress.\nForgot to tell you that this term was popularized by Jeremy Parish, a great video game journalist that also makes awesome YouTube videos on retro gaming and all that cool “beginning of beginnings” and “how we got where we are” stuff we all like to hear people talk about because is nostalgic, and we need to feel something else than depression, but I digress (again). It\u0026rsquo;s a deep dive into retro gaming.\nOkay okay man, I will play. But what is so special about these games? Look, bro… they just are. They have great storytelling, beautiful environments, wonderful music, fantastic art and they are FUN. Games are supposed to be fun, dude. Most of the metroidvanias out there are. Of course there’s some shit game someone made when they were learning how to make games or just developers thinking us gamers, connoisseurs of the great art that are video games, will spend their money on a shit/mediocre sequel made just to money grab our asses.\nExpanding on my “beautiful environments” argument, look at this image:\nHollow Knight resting bench\nAnd that’s only a fraction of the world, a still image of the map.\nNow listen to this from Ori and the blind forest, a song from the OST.\nAs said before, art. Even better, playable art.\nMetroid and Castlevania is a tremendous influence on game developers, gamers and even people outside this world that is gaming have been influenced by these games in one way or another. I just wanted to talk about it and shed some light on what this term is, why these games are great and maybe get you to try and play some or at least one of the games I mentioned.\nMetroidvania is not just a genre, it has made possible that the 2D aesthetic remains popular and more important than anything it has made possible for indie developers to create fantastic games and with that get the opportunity to make more awesome games or cool sequels to their previous one. I’m obviously nostalgic about it, but I know for sure games can make you feel better and happier, and most of these games don\u0026rsquo;t have complex mechanics, making them an excellent starting point for newcomers to the world of gaming.\nWell, thanks, I guess. You are very welcome. Maybe one of my next posts will be about my favorite games. Still, make sure you not only play these games but dive a little bit on how they were made, I always find myself caring and enjoying something more when I understand the effort required to create the final product and what inspired all the work done.\nBut that’s about it, if you want more information you can just google stuff, the correct way of getting more info on something you don’t know.\nPlay games, doesn’t matter what you like, there\u0026rsquo;s some random ass game out there that you will like and then make a whole post on your blog yapping about it because you want people to know a little more about it, or you can go to YouTube and watch more than 3 hours of content on the lore of a game you just played but can\u0026rsquo;t get enough of it, then use a 1-hour-long video of said lore as a sleeping aid because its kind of relaxing, and you found some comfort in that, but I digress.\nThat’s about it.\nThanks to the creators of this amazing games, you made my life more enjoyable.\n","permalink":"https://oscar-fdz.com/posts/metroidvania/","summary":"What is that?
