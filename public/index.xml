      <description>What is that? Simple, metroidvania is a term used to refer to action-adventure games that have a specific set of characteristics and mechanics, the most obvious one is that these types of games are “open-ended” meaning that you can back-track your steps and acquire new items or maybe a new skill that helps you make progress in the game. The term comes from the fusion of two game titles: Metroid (1986) and Castlevania (1986).</description>

      <description>THE FIRST POST The name is Oscar Fernandez, author of this personal website where I expect to fill with some random information about video games, anime, music, coding, and other interesting things that I want to know about or maybe explore new ways of making content.
Another thing that I want to do with this is create a space (portfolio) to be able to express myself and showcase some of my work.</description>
