But that could be said of almost any type of art, I guess that’s why art has such an impactful influence in the world and in human lives, either those who make or those who enjoy it.\nMusic for me is:\nComfort: it relaxes me, makes me feel calm and at ease. Love: a form of letting my love for someone take a musical form that I can share. Empathetic: music can make 2 (or even more) different individuals connect. Fun: music can be fun, make you laugh or dance and sing. A very good way to judge people based on what they like. Without more yapping from me side of the screen, and in no particular order, I present to you:\n5 SONGS WITH A BIG PLACE IN MY HEART audible claps and cheering\nRead with a cool narrator voice, maybe Morgan Freeman, or that girl from WatchMojo\nNUMBER 1 We have a very short but lovely song, Jack Johnson’s Angel from his album Sleep Through The Static.\nIn my opinion, one of the best albums by mister Johnson. It makes you feel like static but in a good way. An almost thematic album with songs that feel extraordinarily personal and impersonal at the same time, making you feel nostalgic and sad, but in the good way. A lot of feel feelings felt if you know what I mean. Angel is that one song I will only share with the love of my life. It encapsulates in just 2 minutes how I want my love life to be: with a lovely angel making little angels. Jack Johnson is one of my all-time favorite artists, his music is kind of a fraction of the definition of my personality, a big fraction, like 15/16. There’s really not a lot I want to say about this song or Jack himself, other than there’s more to “feel” about it. Only listen to the song if you are the love of my life.\nRead in a boxing match announcer voice\nAND ON THE BLUE CORNER, NUUUUUMMMBEEERR TWWOOOOOO Julio Cesar Chavez shadow-boxing showing off\nHad to do it, sorry.\nThe next one is a song with a “fuzzy-chill-nightime-madrugada” vibe. HONNE’s Warm On a Cold Night from their EP album Warm On a Cold Night, and their later album Warm on a Cold Night, afterward called Warm On a Cold Night (Deluxe).\nIt’s only game, why you haff to be mad?\nIn all seriousness, this song got to me in a time in my life where I didn’t have any sort of worries or stress, it arrived one cold night to make my heart feel warm. It presented me with the existence of this English music duo that makes awesome music with a very heartfelt and heartwarming side to it. Without a doubt, it became one of my favorite bands/duo in this beautiful but Cold Night of a world. I had to repeat the name so you get stuck with it and have to listen to the song, GO now! WAIT!!\nBefore you go, this song has a very big place in my heart. HONNE is also one of the favorite duos of my great and mathematically norteño friend: Luis Mario.\nThat we both found out “accidentally” that we loved their music is one of the best moments of our friendship, it could be compared with those moments in movies where two white girls meet and scream at each other dramatically and annoyingly AF, but in a cool just-two-bros-having-something-they-both-love-in-common way. You can keep reading now, kisses.\nNow read out-loud in your lovely voice, but in a cool way\nI’M DICK nice to meet you… NUMBER THREEE me laughing alone in some café\nYou just got got. “Fooled” in understandable and civil terms.\nNow I present to you, Dromedarios Magicos \u0026 José Madero’s Las Horas from Dromedarios album Bicampeón.\nHonorable mentions: Tu Cama and Los Malaventurados No Lloran, the former is by Dromedarios the latter is by Jose Madero (Panda lead vocal, stylized as PXNDX).\nNow this one is a tricky one, but not on the “got got” way you experienced; more like in a “this reminds me of my late friend”.\nI know death is a serious matter, but this is my friend and my way of handling these types of topics. José Madero is, or was, my friend’s (Alberto Mendoza) favorite artist, the song doesn’t really have anything related to how I felt about him or our relationship, but it’s a really nice song that for some reason makes me remember him and what he represented in my life. In life and death, my friend would have a laugh or two reading this post, and that makes me happy.\nBy now just read it however you prefer… Psych! Do it as if it was the DK rap\nHe-he-here we go! So they’re finally here, performing for you\nIf you know the words, you can join in too\nPut your hands together, if you want to clap\nAs we take you through this monkey rap!\nHuh!\nN4, Number four! Old and cringe just like any respectable Dad.\nNote\nI’m not even sorry.\nThis song has been in my life since I can remember, so like 2006 or later. Man, getting old is hard, but I digress.\nFrom genre defining Celtic Metal band, Mägo de Oz’z Molinos de Viento is one hell of a song that accompanied me throughout all my puberty and then some more. Awesome people who really like metal and music in general agree that Mago’s Molinos de viento is a fucking banger, all-time classic, ageless tune to bang your head to and sing out loud holding a beer tankard making a mess of a random Irish bar that for some reason plays Spanish pagan rock music so it starts with Molinos then Fiesta Pagana begins, and every single one gets up and fucking sings their heart out.\nMago de Oz has a more meaningful way of making music, they make statements, display pagan and/or non-religious ideas that make you realize that paying the “diezmo” it’s like getting scammed. Church, not a cool dude making you pay some money just because the havens say they need more buildings and gold statues, or new streets and that it’s for your wellbeing, then you have to present your income for the year and get asked questions to see how much you have to pay by April 15th or the end of the fiscal year, shit wrong Capitalist, I mean, organization. You get what I mean. These dudes were the beginning of some culturally charged movement that opposed some of the best ingrained ideas people have even at this point in time.\nTalking religion it’s not the point nor something I’m an expert on, but free speech bitch one finger you know well.\nMago de Oz = Metal-fucking-good-meaningful music.\nLast but not least.\nI know we have been through a lot reading this post, maybe you had fun, I did. The time has come that you read the last one, but will do it together, ready?\nRead as if your brother’s name was Mario and because of that also your last name is Mario, so you can’t escape the fate of always being that green guy always behind some red dude that can’t keep one bitch safe.\nITS A MEEE NUMBER FIIIVEE!! Note: I did not do more numbers because I’m not creative enough to keep this nonsense going.\nFinally, the best Bolero duo, Daniel, Me Estás Matando’s Somos algo from the album Grandes Éxitos del Boleroglam Vol. 1, it’s one of my favorite songs by Daniel. A unique spin on the Bolero genre that keeps its roots but refreshes the production with a more contemporary vibe and more “current” lyrics.\nThis is another special one for me for two reasons:\nThey are fucking fantastic and make great Boleros.\nBoleros was the favorite music genre of my late grandmother. Every single time I listen to Daniel, she is the only thing on my mind, then I imagine what she would have said if I showed her how they sounded like. I never had the opportunity to do so, I don’t regret it, but I’m completely sure that she would have enjoyed their music. She used to listen a lot of music all the time, and from almost every genre, she didn’t care. I loved hearing her humming to a random song that she didn’t know, but obviously she liked.\nSo these dudes almost make me cry every time I listen to them, but in a happy-sad way. I can certainly say that they are the 1/16 that’s left of my personality.\nAaaaand that’s about it, for now at least. I love music and have so much more songs to share and give my feelings about, but I wanted to keep this post a little more short, and kind of give my “whys” and make “stupid read-like-this jokes” that I didn’t plan on doing. I will most likely do more posts about music and songs I love. Finally, I hope you had a nice time reading and at least listen to one of the songs I mentioned, if not, then go fu…\nHard cut to credits.\nIn loving memory of the most loving grandma, Maria del Carmen Loera and Alberto “Pato” Mendoza, a great friend with a big heart and a fucked up sense of humor, just as black as mine.\nProduced and Directed by yours truly,\nOscar Fdz\n",

<p>In my opinion, one of the best albums by mister Johnson. It makes you feel like static but in a good way. An almost thematic album with songs that feel extraordinarily personal and impersonal at the same time, making you feel nostalgic and sad, but in the good way. A lot of feel feelings felt if you know what I mean.

Only listen to the song if you are the love of my life.</p>

<p>It’s only game, why you haff to be mad?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this song got to me in a time in my life where I didn&rsquo;t have any sort of worries or stress, it arrived one cold night to make my heart feel warm. It presented me with the existence of this English music duo that makes awesome music with a very heartfelt and heartwarming side to it.

I had to repeat the name so you get stuck with it and have to listen to the song, GO now!
WAIT!!</p>
<p>Before you go, this song has a very big place in my heart. HONNE is also one of the favorite duos of my great and mathematically norteño friend: <a href="https://lmcj.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luis Mario</a>.</p>

<p>You just got got. “Fooled” in understandable and civil terms.</p>
<p>Now I present to you, Dromedarios Magicos &amp; José Madero’s <strong>Las Horas</strong> from Dromedarios album Bicampeón.</p>

<p>Honorable mentions: <strong>Tu Cama</strong> and <strong>Los Malaventurados No Lloran</strong>, the former is  by Dromedarios the latter is by Jose Madero (Panda lead vocal, stylized as PXNDX).</p>
<p>Now this one is a tricky one, but not on the “got got” way you experienced; more like in a “this reminds me of my late friend”.</p>
<p>I know death is a serious matter, but this is my friend and my way of handling these types of topics. José Madero is, or was, my friend’s (Alberto Mendoza) favorite artist, the song doesn’t really have anything related to how I felt about him or our relationship, but it’s a really nice song that for some reason makes me remember him and what he represented in my life. In life and death, my friend would have a laugh or two reading this post, and that makes me happy.</p>

<p>This song has been in my life since I can remember, so like 2006 or later. Man, getting old is hard, but I digress.</p>
<p>From genre defining Celtic Metal band, Mägo de Oz’z <strong>Molinos de Viento</strong> is one hell of a song that accompanied me throughout all my puberty and then some more. Awesome people who really like metal and music in general agree that Mago’s Molinos de viento is a fucking banger, all-time classic, ageless tune to bang your head to and sing out loud holding a beer tankard making a mess of a random Irish bar that for some reason plays Spanish pagan rock music so it starts with Molinos then Fiesta Pagana begins, and every single one gets up and fucking sings their heart out.</p>

<p>Mago de Oz has a more meaningful way of making music, they make statements, display pagan and/or non-religious ideas that make you realize that paying the “diezmo” it’s like getting scammed. Church, not a cool dude making you pay some money just because the havens say they need more buildings and gold statues, or new streets and that it&rsquo;s for your wellbeing, then you have to present your income for the year and get asked questions to see how much you have to pay by April 15th or the end of the fiscal year, shit wrong Capitalist, I mean, organization. You get what I mean. These dudes were the beginning of some culturally charged movement that opposed some of the best ingrained ideas people have even at this point in time.</p>
<p>Talking religion it’s not the point nor something I&rsquo;m an expert on, but free speech bitch <em>one finger you know well</em>.</p>
<p>Mago de Oz = Metal-fucking-good-meaningful music.</p>
<p>Last but not least.</p>
<p>I know we have been through a lot reading this post, maybe you had fun, I did. The time has come that you read the last one, but will do it together, ready?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read as if your brother’s name was Mario and because of that also your last name is Mario, so you can&rsquo;t escape the fate of always being that green guy always behind some red dude that can&rsquo;t keep one bitch safe.</p>

<h3 id="its-a-meee-number-fiiivee">ITS A MEEE NUMBER FIIIVEE!!<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-a-meee-number-fiiivee">#</a></h3>
<p>Note: I did not do more numbers because I&rsquo;m not creative enough to keep this nonsense going.</p>
<p>Finally, the best Bolero duo, Daniel, Me Estás Matando’s <strong>Somos algo</strong> from the album Grandes Éxitos del Boleroglam Vol. 1, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite songs by Daniel. A unique spin on the Bolero genre that keeps its roots but refreshes the production with a more contemporary vibe and more “current” lyrics.</p>

<p>This is another special one for me for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They are fucking fantastic and make great Boleros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boleros was the favorite music genre of my late grandmother. Every single time I listen to Daniel, she is the only thing on my mind, then I imagine what she would have said if I showed her how they sounded like. I never had the opportunity to do so, I don&rsquo;t regret it, but I&rsquo;m completely sure that she would have enjoyed their music. She used to listen a lot of music all the time, and from almost every genre, she didn’t care. I loved hearing her humming to a random song that she didn&rsquo;t know, but obviously she liked.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So these dudes almost make me cry every time I listen to them, but in a happy-sad way. I can certainly say that they are the 1/16 that&rsquo;s left of my personality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aaaaand that’s about it, for now at least. I love music and have so much more songs to share and give my feelings about, but I wanted to keep this post a little more short, and kind of give my “whys” and make “stupid read-like-this jokes” that I didn&rsquo;t plan on doing. I will most likely do more posts about music and songs I love.
Finally, I hope you had a nice time reading and at least listen to one of the songs I mentioned, if not, then go fu…</p>
<p>Hard cut to credits.</p>
<p>In loving memory of the most loving grandma, Maria del Carmen Loera and Alberto “Pato” Mendoza, a great friend with a big heart and a fucked up sense of humor, just as black as mine.</p>
