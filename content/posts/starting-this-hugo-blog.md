## THE FIRST POST

The name is Oscar Fernandez, author of this personal website where I expect to fill
with some random information about video games, anime, music, coding, and other interesting things
that I want to know about or maybe explore new ways of making content. 

Another thing that I want to do with this is create a space (portfolio) to be able to express myself and showcase 
some of my work.

More than wanting to share this with others, what my main objective is: to keep tabs on myself and have a space where
I can explore and have a chronological understanding of my evolution as a person. 

I welcome you to this project, feel free to read, share and comment on my posts, ideas and anything else that you 
find wandering in this place. 


Credit to my dearest and one of the best friends I have LMCJ, for the idea of making a personal website. And me, for 
taking the responsibility and effort of making this project something of value to me and maybe other people.
Finally, to Hugo, that makes this project possible, please visit [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website.
